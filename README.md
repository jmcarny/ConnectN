# ConnectN
Write a program to implement the game connect-n. Connect-n is like Connect-4 but the size of the board the number of pieces in a row needed to win are user parameters. If you have never played Connect-4 before you can play it here: https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/connect4.html. The basic gist of the game is that each player takes a turn dropping one of their pieces into a column. Pieces land on top of pieces already played in that column. Each player is trying to get n pieces in a row either veritcally, horizontally or diagonally. The game ends if either player gets n pieces in a row or the board becomes full.
